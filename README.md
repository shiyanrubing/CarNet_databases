# CarNet_databases
This project contains our three crack detection datasetsï¼Œi.e., Sun520, Rain365, and BJN260.

# Overview

Cracks as common pavement defects, provide a sign of potential road damage. Pixel-level pavement crack detection is of great importance for intelligent transportation. However, it is challenging since cracks usually manifest themselves in various characteristics, such as low contrast, poor continuity, extreme aspect ratio, multiple scales and etc. These crack charateristics may attribute to some external environments, such as weather, light, crack pictures captured in different viewpoints and etc, or their inherent properties.

Visual examples of different interference factors. (a), (b), (c), and (d) contain shadows on sunny days, rainwater on rainy days, uneven illuminations in night scenes, and grain-like texture in the background, respectively.
